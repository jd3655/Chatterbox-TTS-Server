    How have we been in here for forty-five minutes and only solved two puzzles?!
    [clear throat] Let''s think logically. [sniff] This room smells like fear and
    bad decisions. [cough] And also someone''s very strong cologne, Kevin. [sigh]
    Okay, the clue says "the answer lies where time stands still." [chuckle] Great,
    very helpful, very straightforward. [shush] Everyone stop talking for one second!
    [gasp] Wait, the clock on the wall! It''s stuck at three fifteen! [laugh] That''s
    it! That has to be it! [groan] It''s not the combination. Of course it''s not
    the combination. [sniff] Why would anything in this room be logical? [sigh] Has
    anyone checked under the carpet? [gasp] There''s a hidden compartment! [chuckle]
    Kevin, you''re standing on a clue! Classic Kevin! [clear throat] Okay, it''s another
    riddle. "What has keys but no locks, space but no room, and you can enter but
    can''t go inside?" [groan] Who writes these things?! [cough] A keyboard! It''s
    a keyboard! [laugh] There''s a keyboard painted on the wall! [gasp] Eight minutes!
    We have eight minutes! [sigh] If we don''t escape this room, we''re never speaking
    of this again. [shush] Focus, everyone! [chuckle] We''re so close I can taste
    freedom! [sniff] That or more of Kevin''s cologne!
